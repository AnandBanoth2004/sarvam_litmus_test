# LLM Chatbot

This project is a scalable chatbot system built using a large language model (LLM). It is designed to handle over **10,000 concurrent users** by leveraging a microservices architecture with Docker-based deployment.

## **Overall Approach and Design Philosophy**

The design is based on a modular, microservices-based architecture, separating the frontend and backend to enable independent scaling and efficient resource utilization.

### **Key Principles:**
- **Separation of Concerns:** The frontend (React-based) and backend (Python Flask) are decoupled for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Containerization:** Docker ensures consistency across development and production.
- **Horizontal Scalability:** Load balancing and Docker Compose facilitate handling high traffic volumes.
- **Stateless Backend:** The backend processes are stateless to allow dynamic scaling without state conflicts.

## **How the System Handles Scale**

### **1. Microservices Architecture**
- Backend and frontend services are independent, enabling horizontal scaling of both components.
- The backend handles user sessions and state management using in-memory solutions (e.g., Redis).

### **2. Containerized Deployment**
- Docker Compose manages service orchestration.
- Independent scaling of backend and frontend containers based on workload.

### **3. Load Balancing**
- The backend is stateless, so load balancing can distribute traffic across multiple instances.
- Docker networking ensures smooth communication between services.

### **4. Efficient Model Handling**
- The LLM is hosted separately or integrated using an optimized model server (e.g., TensorFlow Serving or FastAPI).
- Responses are cached to reduce model inference latency and improve throughput.

## **Key Technical Decisions and Justification**

### **Microservices + Docker**
- Enables flexible deployment and independent scaling of components.
- Improves fault isolation and recovery.

### **Flask for Backend**
- Lightweight and fast.
- Simple to integrate with LLM.

### **React for Frontend**
- Fast, responsive UI.
- Component-based design simplifies future extensions.

### **Stateless Design**
- Statelessness allows scaling out by adding more containers without state conflicts.

### **Load Balancing**
- Ensures even distribution of traffic and prevents bottlenecks.
